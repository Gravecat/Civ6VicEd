# Civ6 Victory Editor

A very simple C++ app to edit Civilization VI saved game files, and toggle the various victory conditions on and off (for example, to disable the possibility of scientific victory mid-game).

Usage: just run the binary with your saved game file as a parameter, for example:

`civ6viced.exe "FREDERICK BARBAROSSA 186 1250 AD.Civ6Save"`

Then use the menu to toggle victory conditions on and off, and either re-save your game, or abort and don't save.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVED GAME FILE FIRST!**
